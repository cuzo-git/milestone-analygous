                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I've made my home base in Miami, Florida with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a great interest in ecommerce. As I started doing business online, I discovered important features my website needed to be able to stand out and be functional to my audience.  I was hooked with the idea of creating more websites.  I started helping friends and family that needed an online presence.</p>
                    <p>That interest in ecommerce was the beginning of an opened door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my life. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
